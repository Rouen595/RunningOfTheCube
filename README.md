# RunningOfTheCube
 Unity project for class, based on Brackey's "How to make a video game" series on YouTube. This the first game that I have created myself, as the first, Sheep Saver, largely consisted of prefabbed models. 
 
 The game consists of a ground platform, obstacles, and a player cube that must navigate to the end. The player must dodge all obstacles on the platform to win.
